        <h1>About Us - PlantPal</h1>

        <p><strong>Welcome to PlantPal</strong>, your trusted partner in sustainable farming!</p>

        <p>At PlantPal, we understand the challenges farmers face in maintaining healthy crops. Whether you're managing a large agricultural operation or a small farm, protecting your crops from diseases is crucial for ensuring a successful harvest. That's why we've created a platform designed to help farmers diagnose and manage plant diseases with the power of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

        <p>Our mission is to provide farmers with fast, accurate, and reliable plant disease detection to help them make informed decisions, minimize crop losses, and maximize yield. With PlantPal, you can easily detect plant diseases early and take preventive or corrective measures before they spread.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>PlantPal allows farmers to upload images of their crops, which are then analyzed by our advanced AI technology. The AI scans the images, identifies potential diseases, and compares them with a comprehensive database of plant diseases. It provides a prediction of the disease affecting the plant along with the confidence level, enabling you to take immediate action to safeguard your crops.</p>

        <p>In addition to disease detection, PlantPal offers valuable resources about common plant diseases—symptoms, causes, and effective treatments. Our goal is to help farmers not only identify diseases but also understand how to manage and prevent them for healthier crops.</p>

PlantPal aims to be a go-to resource for farmers around the world, offering quick, accurate, and actionable insights that support efficient farming practices and improve overall crop management.</p>

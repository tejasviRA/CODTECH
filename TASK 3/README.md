Plant Disease Detection Project: Comprehensive Overview

The Plant Disease Detection Project is a cutting-edge AI-based system that identifies plant diseases from leaf images. Below, we present a structured overview of the project, complete with textual descriptions and code snippets for clarity.

1. About the Project
This project addresses the challenge of early plant disease detection, aiding farmers and agriculturalists in combating crop loss.
It leverages deep learning models to classify diseases, providing confidence scores and severity levels.

2. Features
Upload images of plant leaves for real-time disease detection.
Predicts diseases such as Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus and Powdery Mildew.
Offers a clean, user-friendly interface built using Flask.
Provides disease-specific treatment recommendations.

3. Dataset
The dataset comprises plant leaf images categorized into healthy and diseased classes.
Examples include:
Healthy Plants: Tomato___healthy, Grape___healthy
Diseased Plants: Apple___Black_rot, Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight
Images are preprocessed with augmentation for robust training.

4. Technologies Used
